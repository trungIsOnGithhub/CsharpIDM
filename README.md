This console application was created for the purpose of learning the C# language. It enable user with some(and maybe more) functionalities:

- View a table of all files in a directory (including file size and last access timestamp).
- View a table of all subfolders in a directory (pretty much the same idea as above).
- Create, delete, move, rename, read text from and write text to files, as well as searching text files for specific phrases.
- Create, delete, move and rename folders.
- Create and save an 'index.txt' file, which displays all of the files and subfolders in a directory, with some useful information (basically the same thing as the first 2 bullet points, but in a HANDY and CONVENIENT text file).
- Colorful console animation!
